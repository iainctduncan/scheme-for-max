S4M carray notes, sept 2024

2024: renamed to carrays so won't be confused with max arrays

- there are tests for all the types (i,f,s,c) in scm/carray_tests.scm
  - they test make-carray, arrsv, a->v, carray-ref, and carray-set!
  - these need to be added to the regression suite though

WORKING 
- make-carray
- carray->vector
- arrsv (carray set from vector)
- carray-ref
- carray-set!

- s4m_free_carray - sort of working

TODO:
- bring back vector set from carray later, ok without it for now
- add the carray tests to the main regression suite



ISSUES:
- what happens if we make a new carray overwriting a previous one?
  - it should automatically free the old one
- have I written free functions for these properly?
  - what happens if an s4m instance is delete when an carray exists?
    - doesn't crash
- do we protect against trying to put bad types in the carray yet?
