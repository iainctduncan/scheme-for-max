Notes on running one liners as expr in the s4m box

- will need an sexpr version of the dispatcher

- working for ints and floats, but not for lists, dispatcher needs overhaul
- shelving this for now in a branch, more complex than I though

s4m expr requirements
- DONE figure out how many ins to make based on the number of inX arguments in the string
- Vector with all the inputs now exits

- dispatcher needs to deal correctly with ins for all types:
  D int 
  D float
  D list - but has issues
  symbol
  D bang

BUGS:
- building inlets fucked when an input num used more than once
- bug with bootup, when I recover work it seems the expr hasn't loaded sometimes
  (out of order processing maybe?, doesn't run the init function)
- can't handle symbol lists yet
- cons a number to a list, but not a list to a list,
  I get a unhandled conversion error

LEFT OFF: 2021-09-8
- it's basically working but chokes on some input types, esp when lists
  go in the wrong places
- building inlets fucked when an input num used more than once
- trying to cons a list to a list crashes it, can't figure out why
- need to back burner this for a while
