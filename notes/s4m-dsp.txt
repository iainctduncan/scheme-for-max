Notes on trying the dsp verion

- outlet creation will be all buggered, need to fix that

- I got audio rendering, but as soon as I changed a variable used in the audio
  routine from outside, it crashed, so not sure if this will actually every work
  - it crashes as soon as it tries to read a global variable, does turning off the gc help??
  - even with the gc locked out of the dsp routine, it's a crash as soon as I update the global

- I wonder if I can just use the perform routine to set a clock to run in the scheduler
  once a cycle though??
