Notes on attempt to make isolated s4m~

Thoughts:
- patches don't start with DSP on, so perhaps we can simply 
  force that running the interpreter outside of dsp can *only* happen if dsp
  is not running? (is there a way to check that)
- next: get loading some scheme, make a different bootstrap file



Progress

- first step, make a new object that is audio pass through

- created the shell, added new s4m_msp_init_s7 function

- got s7 initializing

- next step is getting it bootstrapping

- I think
