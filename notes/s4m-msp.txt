Notes on attempt to make isolated s4m~


Progress

- first step, make a new object that is audio pass through
- created the shell, added new s4m_msp_init_s7 function
- got s7 initializing
- made a new boostrap file, s4m-msp.scm, and got it loading
- can't include this in both places #include "common/commonsyms.c", so using gensym("") instead of _sym_nothing
- got audio going in an out to scm over a vector
  - should ask Bill about using shared memory instead??


Thoughts:
- patches don't start with DSP on, so perhaps we can simply 
  force that running the interpreter outside of dsp can *only* happen if dsp
  is not running? (is there a way to check that)
- next: get loading some scheme, make a different bootstrap file

ISSUES TO FIX:
- the buffer will need to be unique to the s4m instance, so it will need to be created
  by it and have a unique handle

- trying messages through buffer, seems to be fine

NEXT
- need to have audio pass in to scheme properly
- need to have scheme errors not tank the dsp routine


- audio in2 is not working
