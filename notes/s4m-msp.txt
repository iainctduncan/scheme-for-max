Notes on attempt to make isolated s4m~


Progress

- first step, make a new object that is audio pass through
- created the shell, added new s4m_msp_init_s7 function
- got s7 initializing
- made a new boostrap file, s4m-msp.scm, and got it loading
- can't include this in both places #include "common/commonsyms.c", so using gensym("") instead of _sym_nothing



Thoughts:
- patches don't start with DSP on, so perhaps we can simply 
  force that running the interpreter outside of dsp can *only* happen if dsp
  is not running? (is there a way to check that)
- next: get loading some scheme, make a different bootstrap file
 

Left off:
- I don't think x->source_file got setup properly, it's just null all the time

- left off, about to alter the vector in scheme
